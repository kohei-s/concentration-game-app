## 1. Concept 📱
New concentration game app aims to support learning Japanese for so called [third culture kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid) growing up speaking a different language in kindergarten or school. The name of the app *KoToKO (言と言)* is a neologism that could mean *Word & Word*.
## 2. Problem 😦
- Difficulty of staying motivated to learn the Japanese language in non-Japanese speaking countries
- Frustration of not being properly understood in Japanese by their own families
## 3. MVP 💮
Simple concentration game with elementary Japanese [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) characters 
## 4. Target group 🧒🏾🧒🏼🧒🏿🧒🏻🧒🏽
Children between 5-15 years old learning Japanese as (one of) their home language(s), as well as their parents who want to support the learning journey

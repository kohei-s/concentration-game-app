#  KoToKo: Japanese concentration game app 
This mobile application (🛠️ in development) is conducted as my personal capstone project for [Java Development Bootcamp at neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/en/bootcamp/java-development) from May to August 2023
## 1. Concept 📱
 Concentration game app to support Japanese learning especially for [third culture kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid) grwoing up speaking a different language in kindergarten or school. The name of the app KoToKO (言と言) is a neologism that could mean Word & Word
## 2. Problem 😦
- Difficulty of staying motivated to learn the Japanese language in non-Japanese speaking countries
- Frustration of not being properly understood in Japanese by their own families 
## 3. MVP 💮
Simple concentration game with elementary Japanese characters ([Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) & [Katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana))
## 4. Target group 🧒🏾🧒🏼🧒🏿🧒🏻🧒🏽
Children between 5-15 years old learning Japanese as (one of) thier home language(s) with basic technological literacy, as well as their parents supporting for their learning jouney
